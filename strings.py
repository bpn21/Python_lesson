# The index in the string starts from 0 to length-1
# a = "bipin"
# b = index 0
# i = index 1
# p = index 2
# i = index 3 
# n = index 4

# Length of string ?
# a = "bipin"
# length = len(a)
# print(length)


# # String concatination in python
# a = "bipin"
# b = "gaire"
# print(a,b)
# # NOTE :: There will be space between bipin and gaire .i.e bipin gaire
# print(a + b)
# # NOTE :: there will not be space in between two strings. i.e bipingaire
